# Gesture Recognition

Using IMUs (triaxial accelerometer plus gyro).

## Datasets

* [SmartWatch Gestures Dataset](https://tev.fbk.eu/resources/smartwatch).
8 users, 20 repetitions of 20 different gestures. 3-axis accelerometer. Smartwatch on right wrist.
* [Australian Sign Language signs Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Australian+Sign+Language+signs).
95 signs were collected from five signers. Noisy. XYZ, roll, plus finger bend.
* [A Survey of Datasets for Human Gesture Recognition](https://diuf.unifr.ch/people/lalanned/Articles/RuffieuxHCII2014.pdf)
lists some 15 datasets, but only for image-based gesture recognition, mostly collected with Kinect.

* [Xie & Pan 2014 - Accelerometer Gesture Recognition](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2014/Michael%20Xie,%20David%20Pan,%20Accelerometer%20Gesture%20Recognition.pdf). Dynamic-Threshold Truncation feature preprocessing increased.
With 5 classes and only 1 training example per-class was able to reach 96% accuracy.
Using multiple examples, both SVM and Naive Bayes performed well.

Proposes an improved a distance-based model with kNN classification with low computational overhead.

5% increase in accuracy with transfer compared to without.

Builds a model of the errors of gestures, and uses it to improve HMM-based classifier.

Template based approach, using Euclidean distance and nearest neighbours type classification.
Extension of [$1 Unistroke Recognizer](http://depts.washington.edu/acelab/proj/dollar/index.html).
Used differencing to compute a "tracte" from the acceleration data itself. Can be plotted in 3d/2d.
Re-sampling to a fixed number of samples, to match those in the template library.
Supports up to 10 different samples. Designed for rapid prototyping of gesture-based interfaces.

## Feature processing

* Vector quantization
* Acceleration statistics
* Motion histogram
* Zero velocity compensation (ZVC)
* DWT. [FastDWT](https://cs.fit.edu/~pkc/papers/tdm04.pdf), approximation of DTW in linear time and linear space.
