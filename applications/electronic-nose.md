# Electronic nose

An [electronic nose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_nose) is an electronic sensing device intended to detect odors or flavors.
Using a array of sensor that can detect various gases. 

Can be used for quality control, estimating perceptual qualities.
For food, beverages, perfumes, air quality, et.c.

The gas sensors used are often of Metal Oxide semiconductor (MOX) type.

#### Temperature dependence

Metal Oxide Sensors for Electronic Noses and Their Application to Food Analysis
2010, Berna
"sensors run at different temperatures will show a degree of selectivity to each gas without increasing the number of sensors"
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3274253/

"more gas features can be obtained by modulating the operating temperature of the gas sensors"
