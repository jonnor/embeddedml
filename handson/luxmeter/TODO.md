### Quick demo

- Show results on screen
- Make short demo video. 1 minute

### On-device learning

- Try to re-implement the learning in MicroPython, run on-device
MinMaxScaler
Random sampling from files?
train_test split. Ideally respecting groups
RMSE error reporting
r2 metric calculation
- ? positive constraint in emlearn_linreg ?

### More functional Lux meter
Main problem: Only really accepts light straigth from the front
! angle(s) becomes new factors in data collection and test

- Try make a plastic dome. 3d-print and sand
