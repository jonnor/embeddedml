- Figure out why picking a single datapoint is much better than median.
And why some datapoint work much better than others.
And why random picking falls apart.
Is there some startup effect? Or cyclic effect?

- Test model on data, on device.
May need a load weights/bias function in emlearn_linreg
Or just use a pure Python version initially
Need to load data from .npy files, and apply median filter, and feature scaling
- Test model in live setting
