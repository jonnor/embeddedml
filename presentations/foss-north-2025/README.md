## Abstract

Learn to build powerful sensors running on low-cost microcontrollers, all in Python!

Did you known that (Micro)Python can scale all the way down to microcontrollers that have less than 1 MB of RAM and program memory? Such devices can cost just a few dollars, and are widely used to measure, log, analyze and react to physical phenomena. This enables a wide range of useful and fun applications - be it for a smart home, wearables, scientific measurements, consumer products or industrial solutions.

In this talk, we will demonstrate how to get started with MicroPython on a ESP32 microcontroller. We will first show how to create a basic Internet-connected sensor node using simple analog/digital sensors. And then we will show how to create advanced sensors that use Digital Signal Processing and Machine Learning to analyze microphone, accelerometer or camera data.
