# Wokwi

Using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) as the simulator for the tutorial.
Here are some notes for that.

### Status

Have selected Pico W as the base.
Developing example at
https://wokwi.com/projects/465018105144566785

### Open questions

Must-test

- MPU6050
- Does asyncio work as it should?
- Can we run MicroDot and access webserver?

Nice-to-have

- SSD1306 display code
- Can we get mip installed files/libraries to persist, avoid redownloading?
- Can we get WiFi setup to be faster. Right now delays startup by 5 seconds

### Wokwi MicroPython version

! default MicroPython versions were old
```
"attrs": { "env": "micropython-20231005-v1.21.0" }
```
https://wokwi.com/projects/305568836183130690

Pico example currently uses 1.24.1 by default
https://wokwi.com/projects/new/micropython-pi-pico

Updating to 1.25.0 worked
```
    { "id": "pico", "type": "wokwi-pi-pico", "attrs": { "env": "micropython-20250415-v1.25.0" } }
```

The provided firmwares seem to be here:
https://github.com/wokwi/firmware-assets/tree/gh-pages/micropython

The lastest is 1.25.0 for pico, and 1.22 for esp32
u prefix was deprecated in MicroPython v1.21.0.
1.25 was first version supported by emlearn-micropython. But maybe not for RP2040??

Feature request for newer versions
https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-features/issues/1115

Resolved on May 25, 2026 - can now use MicroPython 1.28.0
```
"attrs": { "env": "micropython-20260406-v1.28.0" }
```


### More info
Uri Shaked is one of developers. Have a lot of talks
https://urish.org/#talks

Wokwi can be used locally also, with VSCode extension
Can also be used with a commandline tool, wokwi-cli.
Especially for test-automation.
Can use same tests with hardware-in-the-loop

Shows the Wokwi logic analyser. A component that can capture. Gives out .vcd file, to be opened in PulseView etc.

Custom peripherals ("chips") can be provided by third party.
Write code in C - compiles to WASM.
Or in Verilog.

### Board support

https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-boards/tree/main/boards
Many official ESP32 boards.
Has XIAO ESP32 S3/C6/C3
Has PICO and PICO W
! no PICO 2 W

Virtual WiFi seems to work also on RPI Pico
https://wokwi.com/projects/360519097147837441
Has MicroPython 1.24.1 by default
WiFi worked when updating 1.25.0

### Peripheral support

- Pushbutton. 12 mm. Can trigger actions
- Potmeter. Can set continious value
- LED. Basic blink.
- Buzzer. Audible feedback. Was used in toothbrush project
- Photoresistor. 4-pin breakout. Both analog and digital value
- Analog Temperature Sensor (NTC). 10k-10k
- Accelerometer/IMU. MPU6050. GY-521. I2C mode. Manual orientation control, not motion
- BMP180. Barometric pressure and temperature sensor. I2C
- Rotary encoder. KY-040
- SSD1306 OLED / SH1107 OLED
- PIR Motion Sensor
- DHT22. Temperature and humidity. ! custom protocol, not I2C
- DS1307 RTC

### Serial plotter
There serial monitor can plot values over time
https://docs.wokwi.com/guides/serial-monitor

### Using files/libraries

Code .py be added manually to project as files.
Example:
https://wokwi.com/projects/305568836183130690

Open feature request for package management install:
https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-features/issues/276

Tested install and run of regular MicroPython .py libraries. WORKS
https://wokwi.com/projects/465000314609795073

Tested install and run of native C modules .npy. WORKS
