## Description

In recent years, generative AI models have come to dominate the discourse around artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Both Large Language Models and other generative models for image/video/sound use huge deep learning models, running on expensive and energy intensive GPUs. However, there are several other application areas of machine learning, operating under other constraints.
One of these is the area of "TinyML", where machine learning is used to analyze sensor data on microcontroller-grade systems.
A typical TinyML system is under 1 watt, under 1 MB of RAM and FLASH, and under 10 USD bill-of-materials.

In this presentation, we will talk about machine learning on microcontrollers; the applications, and developments in the field over the last years. We will also cover practical information on how one can get started, using the emlearn open-source project.
emlearn provides machine learning inference implementations for microcontrollers. It is written in portable C99 code, and supports models trained with scikit-learn and Tensorflow/Keras.
Since 2023 the emlearn project also supports MicroPython, a Python for microcontrollers.


## Suggested topics

- Edge and Distributed AI
- Data Management and Processing


## Benefits to ecosystem

Embedded systems are a massive application area that touches many industrial and consumer products.
While traditionally very closed, open-source software is continuing to make inroads.

The TinyML niche of machine learning is extremely concerned with computational efficiency.
This perspective is useful, and sorely needed, also in many other ML/AI applications
- and some of the practices, experiences and techniques may transfer.

Applications of TinyML are often possible to realize on low budgets and time-investment,
using data that one can capture and label oneself, or with a small group.
This can be a very fruitful way of learning practical ML/AI in a hands-on manner.
