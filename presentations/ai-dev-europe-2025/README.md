## Abstract

In recent years, generative AI models have come to dominate the discourse around artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Both Large Language Models and other generative models for image/video/sound use huge deep learning models, running on expensive and energy intensive GPUs. However, there are several other application areas of machine learning, operating under other constraints.
One of these is the area of "TinyML", where machine learning is used to analyze sensor data on microcontroller-grade systems.
A typical TinyML system is under 1 watt, under 1 MB of RAM and FLASH, and under 10 USD bill-of-materials.

In this presentation, we will talk about machine learning on microcontrollers; the applications, and developments in the field over the last years. We will also cover practical information on how one can get started, using the emlearn open-source project.
emlearn provides machine learning inference implementations for microcontrollers. It is written in portable C99 code, and supports models trained with scikit-learn and Tensorflow/Keras.
Since 2023 the emlearn project also supports MicroPython, a Python for microcontrollers.
