https://program.berlinbuzzwords.de/bbuzz26/cfp

Berlin Buzzwords is looking for talks on

```
…any aspect of search: From search engines to relevance engineering, and more.
…Data Science and Making sense of data: AI, ML, Data Wrangling, Data Engineering, MLOps, A/B-testing, etc.
…everything related to stream processing.
…Operations / Infrastructure, including building and maintaining infrastructure, but also delivery and testing.
…Scaling up (taking better advantage of a single machine, with threads, accelerators, specialized libraries, …), scaling out (distribution) or even scaling down; including moving from centralized services to “on device”.
…Storing data and everything that entails.
…experiments, hacks and novel approaches, but also lessons learned, generally-useful algorithms, and experience reports.
…societal, environmental and ethical impact of tech.
…Management, Leadership, Team Culture and internal processes, as well as Open Source & Governance.
```

The list is not complete, and we are always happy about new and unique submissions. If you are looking for inspiration, please check out our YouTube channel to see videos of previous years’ talks.

Guidelines

Make sure you take the following guidelines to heart:

```
Titles should be descriptive and be less than 60 characters long
The abstract should serve as a tl;dr for your session, giving a brief summary of the contents and what the audience can learn.
The session description is the most important part of your proposal, since talks will be rated by our program committee mainly on the basis of your description. A good description contains a detailed and focused outline of your talk, explains why your topic is relevant, what you will be talking about and what the audience will learn.
Please don’t include your biography or personal details in your abstract or description, since personal information will be removed before the review process starts to avoid bias.
Title, abstract, and description of your talk will be visible to everyone and will be used on our talk description pages if your proposal is accepted, so be sure to write a clear and concise text in full sentences and don’t exclusively use bullet points.

```

## Title
Data Science in 1 megabyte - with MicroPython and emlearn

## Length
40 minutes, or 20 minutes

## Abstract



## Description

## Notes

Regular PyData stack is a foundation for science, engineering and education around the globe

MicroPython enables scienstics, engineers, makers and students to use their Python skills
also in the area of physical computing, embedded devices, etc

It is a solid alternative to Arduino etc.

## Takeaways

- MicroPython enables physical computing for those that know Python
- Applicable to many data-oriented applications.
Sensors systems.
Lab gear.
Robotics.
- Can also run in the browser. Interactive, data visualization, etc
- MicroPython in browser enables instant apps

## TODO

- Submit abstract
- Get emlearn-micropython working for browser
- 

## Ideas

Concepts

- Serve MicroPython WASM from device. To do learning in browser. Send model back?

Usecases

- Lab gear
- Wireless Sensor Networks. Ref EuroScipy Krakow 2025
- Educational lab exercises

Demos

- Motion classification
- Audio analysis / Sound Event Detection
- Vis- spectroscopy
- Gesture recognition. With built-in learning. Datavis in browser

Random

- Reference Amy, and their in browser ?
