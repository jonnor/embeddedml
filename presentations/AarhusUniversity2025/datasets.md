Alcohols with different structures are used frequently in hygiene products and cosmetics.
It is desirable to classify these alcohols to evaluate their potential harmful effects using less costly methods.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaozhuang/alcohol-qcm-sensor-dataset

5 types of sensors. QCM3, QCM6, QCM7, QCM10, QCM12
In each sensor, There is alcohol classification of five types
1-octanol, 1-propanol, 2-butanol, 2-propanol, 1-isobutanol


Suitable for on-device learning. KNN may be relevant?

Nearest Neighbor Based Feature Selection for Regression and its Application to Neural Activity
> Our algorithm involves a feature-weighted version of the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm.
leave-one-out mean squared error of the kNN estimator and minimize it using a gradient ascent on an “almost” smooth function.
