# Preparations

## Prerequisites

We assume a Unix-like development environment.
That means either Linux, MacOS or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

- Python 3.10 or later
- A shell/terminal
- git client
- Thonny IDE (for MicroPython)
- A few gigabytes of space to install Python packages

## Install Thonny

Install from https://thonny.org

## Create new virtual environment, install packages

In a project folder for the workshop

    python -m venv emlearn_venv
    source emlearn_venv/bin/activate

In the project folder for the workshop, with emlearn_venv activated

    git clone https://github.com/emlearn/emlearn-micropython.git
    cd emlearn-micropython/examples/har_trees/
    pip install -r requirements.txt
