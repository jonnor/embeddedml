## Abstract

Bridging the TinyML Language Gap with MicroPython and Emlearn
Modern Machine Learning makes it possible to automatically extract valuable information from sensor data, and it has become feasible to deploy ML systems to low-cost embedded devices and sensors. This niche is often referred to as "TinyML", and is enabling a range of new applications in consumer electronics, science and industry.

emlearn is an open-source library for deploying Machine Learning models to any device with a C99 compiler. It provides a Python library for converting standard models (made with scikit-learn and Keras) to efficient C code. The library has been used in a wide range of applications, from detection of vechicles in acoustic sensor nodes, to hand gesture recognition, to real-time malware detection in Android devices.

Zephyr RTOS is a comprehensive open-source operating system for embedded devices. It provides hardware support for a wide range of microcontrollers, including low-power operation and common wireless communication protocols. It also provides standardized "sensors" API and wide range of built-in drivers. These features combined makes the platform very attractive for TinyML applications.

In this presentation, we introduce the emlearn project, and show how it can be used together with Zephyr. We will cover the key features and development tools that the library provides, and demonstrate how one can perform common Machine Learning tasks - classification, regression and anomaly detection.
