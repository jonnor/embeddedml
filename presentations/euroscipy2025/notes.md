## Concept

Focus on scientific application of (IoT) sensor-nodes,
and how they are used.
Highligh how this can be implemented using emlearn + MicroPython.

## The talk

Wednesday, August 20, 1:30 PM
Room 1.19 (Ground Floor)
Computational Tools and Scientific Python Infrastructure

30 minutes slot.
20-25 minutes + QA.

## Communication goals

> You as a scientist, or engineer supporting scientists,

> become familiar with how to create custom sensor systems
> using microcontrollers and (Micro)Python

> including on-sensor data processing
> like digital signal procesing and machine learning
> using emlearn


### Take aways

- Many scientific applications rely on collecting a lot of physical data
- Wireless communication and battery operation often highly desirable for low-cost, scaling deployments
- Wireless sensor nodes are typically using a microcontroller
- Microcontrollers can be programmed in Python using MicroPython
- Microcontrollers can do a decent amount of data processing,
Including audio and image datam and machine learning inference
- MicroPython has good tools for sensor data processing,
including connectivity, storage, performance (Viper/ASM/C modules)
- There are good ecosystem of libraries
Including ulab, emlearn, OpenMV et.c.

### Sensor nodes and Wireless Sensor Networks

Existing slide(s)

- ML-powered sensor node. Architecture
- Microcontrollers, what are they.

Add a bit more.
Especially things that make later parts more relevant.

- Wireless sensor networks. Principle. Deployed in a large area.
Communication to a central point. Via gateway or not.
Non-connected loggers. Storing to SDcard etc. Hybrid, raw data on SD.
- Common wireless protocols.
Typical ranges. Typical data rates. Typical power.
Could be in terms of "typical architectures"?
Motivation for ML on edge: Being able to transmit
- MEMS sensors ? Could be covered under applications also
- Batching of data. Very beneficial. Reducing wakeup times.



####  WiFi
Very easy. Very well supported.
Not power efficient. WiFi 6 improves


#### Cellular
LTE CAT M1 / LTE CAT NB "narrowband iot"
PPP over Serial (PPPoS)
machine.PPP 
https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/network.PPP.html

#### BLE
Ex to mobile phone, or gateway
! NRF52 not so well supported right now.
Zephyr port is improving this.
One of the best low-power BLE chips.
ESP32 not that low power

#### LoRa
LoraWAN.
Public network like ThingsNet
Private network using gateways
https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/tree/34c4ee1647ac4b177ae40adf0ec514660e433dc0/micropython/lora
Support bunch of the most common modules from Semtech SX1262 

- Duty cycle limits: EU has 1% duty cycle restriction (36 seconds/hour transmission time)
- Fair Access Policy: TTN limits to 30 seconds uplink airtime per device per day
- Typical use: Most applications work well with 10-50 byte payloads sent every 15-60 minutes
- Recommendation: Use SF7-SF9 with 20-50 byte payloads

airtime calculator
https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/airtime-calculator
51 bytes SF7, 125 khz, EU686. 118 ms.
With 30 seconds daily, 11 per hour avg
5 minute interval
Might need to go down to 1/2 of this

LoraWAN packet overhead. 13 bytes minimum ?
EU868 SF12: 51 bytes max â†’ 38 bytes application data

Confirmed ACK in LoRaWAN:
Set ADR bit in FCtrl to request confirmation
Device sends uplink with "confirmed" flag
Network server responds with downlink ACK
If no ACK received, device retransmits (up to 8 times default).

Coverage on public network

Krakow has 3 gateways nearby conference center
Oslo have

#### Thread
IP-based. 6LoWPAN / IEEE 802.15.4.
Zigbee uses same transports.

### WSN applications

Especially relevant when measuring at many locations
And want coverage over time

*Spatio-temporal* data


### Examples at different complexity levels

Output data rate on LoRaWAN ex,
40 bytes every 10 minutes


- Low datarate logging
Sleep, measure+send, sleep
No or very simple data processing on edge. Basic averaging/filters etc.
No particular benefit of doing more advanced.

#### Building C programs and running in browser

For usage with Jupyter Lite for emlearn tutorials etc.

Would need to create a Python module, build it with PyScript,
and expose an API that allows to compile a file.
