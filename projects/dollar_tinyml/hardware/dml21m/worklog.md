Testing

- Test CH32V006 with Zephyr. At least I2C, PWM. Preferably also SPI FLASH, power management

PCB design

- Fix buzzer footprint. Should be for 5x5 mm footprint?
- Switch to CH32V006 (Zephyr support)
- Add mousebites for breaking off battery, add battery wire pads
- Maybe. Add microphone input, to OPA channel
