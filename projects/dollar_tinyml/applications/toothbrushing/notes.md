# TODO

PoC, dummy ML

- Integrate state machine and effects
- Design a toothbrush attachment method. Zipties for brush. Costmetic cover?
- Test on device

PoC with ML

- Record some data
- Train model, based on har_trees
- Investigate the on the other dataset?
- Support rotating the motion vector, based on gravity + accelerometer orientation (ref toothbrush orientation)
- Test on device


# Data

#### Dataset for toothbrushing activity using brush-attached and wearable sensors
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921005321
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hx5kkkbr3j/1

Toothbrushing data for 120 sessions performed by 22 participants (11 males, 11 females).
The data was collected using two IMU devices from Mbientlab Inc.
One device was attached to the brush handle, while the other device was used as wearable (wristwatch on the brushing hand).
The participants brush their teeth for around two minutes in each session following a pre-given sequence.

235 MB total.

## Hardware

- Needs accelerometer/IMU.
- And some way of notifying user. LED and/or buzzer.

For prototyping the M5StickC can be used.
A bit bulky, but workable.

Then the `dml20m` hardware would be used to actually demonstrate the 1 USD TinyML concept.

## Existing products

There are timers.
Especially targetting kids.
Some are using an hourglass principle using colored oil.

Some are electronic using light to indicate done.

Tracks where you brush in your mouth.



## Asides

#### Adverserial usage

If someone is trying to fool the device that they are actually brushing their teeth,
can we actually separate that from actual toothbrushing?
Like vigorous shaking. At approximately the right periodicity.
At approximately the right angle even?
Probably not...
But including some roughly similar data from other semi-energetic activities might be a good check for robustness.
