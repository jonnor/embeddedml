A Simple Spectrometer Using Various LEDs and a Photodiode Sensor for Photocatalytic Performance Evaluation

Measure waste water clarity after the photocatalytic treatment.
Simple spectrometer consisting of LEDs with different colors (white, red, blue, green and yellow) as light sources,
a cuvette as vessel of the sample, and a photodiode OPT101 as sensing element.
The red LEDs gave an average error of less than 5%, which is comparable to that obtained by the commercial UV-Vis. 


A promising approach to creating cost-effective spectrometric devices is using a LED & Photodiode Based Spectrometry,
where a set of LEDs tailored to the desired wavelength region and one or more photodiodes (PDs) are used for detection.
