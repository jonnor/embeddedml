#### Magic Wand
Magic wand. With RBG lights as output. Doable on 1 USD budget.
Adding button and RBG LED would allow re-training?
Maybe also a FLASH chip.

Of course plain button inputs would likely be more practical.
Gesture input is a bit of a gimmick. But less fun?? So games seems the most relevant.
- Follow the leader. Repeat same trick.
- Rock, paper, scissors style. 
- Simon says? Do increasingly complicated sequence.

#### Magic Wand BLE controller
BLE would ideally enable connecting as BLE HID device to any computer/tablet/phone.
Need BLE capable microcontroller.
Costs 70 cents. Would be slightly above 1 USD total BOM.
Maybe 433 MHz could be doable?? And use with standard power relays.


#### Air drumsticks
Might be doable with a BLE beacon only?
Use with a companion app on Android phone.
BLE MIDI would make it much more general though
Needs low latency, low jitter.

#### Pet tracker
On device ML not needed?
If can send accelerometer data direct.
Hard to capture dataset.
Checking activity levels etc.

### Noise sensor
With USB as PSU. And sending to an Android phone.

### Teeth brushing timer
Using motion or sound to determine activity happening. 2 minutes minimum.
