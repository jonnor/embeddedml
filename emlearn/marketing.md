## Long form content ideas

For TowardsDataScience or similar.

#### Introduction to open-source TinyML

Write article about open-source TinyML frameworks.
An introduction to what exists
MicroMLGen, m2gen, skompiler, emlearn
NNoM, TensorFlow lite
Publish on Medium?
Scope: Benchmarks are out. Coming later

#### Benchmarking X on TinyML devices 
Performance comparison of TinyML frameworks
MicroMLGen, m2gen, skompiler, emlearn

FLASH, RAM, inference time. Predictive accuracy
- AVR8. 8 bit, no FPU.
- Cortex M0. 32 bit, no FPU. RP2040 ?
- Cortex M4F. 32 bit, FPU. NRF52 ?
- Xtensa. 32 bit, FPU. ESP32. 

Models. Focus on a single one? Ex. RandomForest / DecisionTree.
At a couple of different sizes / problems?
Trained in the same way. Just conversion different

Zephyr is a good base for portability.
But write everything in C99.
Put into emlearn project - maybe as a separate repo

## Medium posts

The demos are decent starting point?
Just need to make sure they are informative enough.
As there is a policy against posts that just reiterate project documentation.

Write a bit more around the core.
For example detection principles. Physics of it, DSP principles 
References to other works.
Put it into a usage context


# TODO

## Minor

Make post in Sound of AI about microvad
Maybe once there is a video

Make a little post in Arduino project-sharing discord.
Color Detector demo?
Sequence detector
