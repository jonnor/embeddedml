# Roadmap

Strategy. Keeping things application-oriented.
Making sure that it is easy to achieve practical tasks,
and that this documented well, and the utility is well demonstrated.

## Next

Support for the standard tasks,
classification, regression and outlier/anomaly detection.

Demos

- Complete IMU classification example in C
Including pre-processing / feature extraction, training pipeline, on-device checks from dataset
HAR in emlearn-micropython is a good starting point
Walking detection, ref https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00745-z ?

Data loading

- Support Numpy .npy files

Classifiers

- Output an enum with the class information, and a const char array
- Switch to only output one inference method at a time.
- Add a wrapper function also in the loadable case, for uniform C API

## Misc

Start writing a CHANGELOG.md
- or add it to docs like sklearn/skimage/librosa etc.?

Support the full width of common models.

Models

- net. MLP autoencoder for anomaly/outlier
- linear. Linear regression
- linear. Logistic regression
- neighbour. kNN regression
- neighbour. Nearest centroid 
- neighbour. Outlier/anomaly
- kernel. SVM regression
- kernel. SVM classification
- kernel. One-class SVM

### Support Vector Machine

People online interested in it for microcontrollers

* https://forum.arduino.cc/t/need-help-support-vector-machine-for-esp32-arduino/1022594

### Logistic regression

Preferably implemented with integer only math
Easy apart from the sigmoid and softmax functions

### Softmax

CMSIS-NN uses a softmax with base 2 instead of base e
Has q15 and q7 versions available
https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/NN/html/group__Softmax.html#ga1cacd8b84b8363079311987d0016ebe5

? is this compatible with sklearn ? or keras Softmax

tflite micro
https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/blob/6d337dc9f96a7f01ac90f3bf8363828fbdfe1e3a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/softmax.h#L68

Various exp optimizations
https://github.com/mratsim/laser/blob/master/research/exp_and_log_optimisation_resources.md

https://github.com/asmekal/softmax-acceleration/blob/master/Fast%20softmax%20approximations.ipynb

### Sigmoid

Typical definition uses expf, which is slow

There are alternative functions that are much faster
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10732027/fast-sigmoid-algorithm/15703984#15703984

CMSIS-NN uses a lookup table
https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/NN/html/group__Acti.html#ga8932b57c8d0ee757511af2d40dcc11e7
Either 256 entries for q7 (256 bytes),
or 128+192 for q15 (640 bytes)

Q7 approach seems suitable for emlearn

## 2.0 - on-device learning

Models

- Isolation Forest training. In C. For continious AD/novelty detection
- Random Forest training. In MicroPython ?
- Maybe move addnode/addroot from emlearn-micropython to emlearn

Demos

- Anomaly Detection in rotating machine. Using accelerometer or sound

## Later

- Streaming stats/summaries
- DTW / on-device gesture detection etc
